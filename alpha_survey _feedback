relevant feedback points:

"In your own words, what does trance feel like to you? Please describe your typical trance experiences."

Suggested rewording: "What's your typical experience like going into and experiencing trance?"
Concern: The word 'feel' might bias respondents towards kinesthetic descriptions
Issue: This question asked for a huge response, which made one respondent "bounce out immediately"
Suggestion: Provide an estimate of how long the survey will take to complete


"How variable is your trance experience?"

Add a clear instruction to respondents:
"For the following questions, please answer based on your most frequent or typical trance experience. You will have an opportunity to describe other experiences later in the survey."


"Which induction methods work best for you for this kind of trance? (Select all that apply)"

Suggestion: Give each option a slider to indicate frequency of use (0-5 scale, 0 being never, 5 being very often)
Add a checkbox for "I use multiple during a single trance session"
Consider adding options for visual fixation, audio, and physical touch
Allow for description of combining multiple methods


"In this trance state, how would you characterize your thoughts? Pick the closest descriptor"

No specific feedback, but consider allowing multiple selections or a ranking system


"How positive or negative do you typically feel in trance (emotionally speaking)?"

Critique: Positive/negative is an odd scale for emotions during trance
Concern: This scale might be interpreted differently by those with psychology backgrounds or emotional sadomasochists
Suggestion: Consider a more nuanced approach to measuring emotional experiences


"How in control of yourself and your experience do you typically feel in trance?"

Suggestion: Separate "completely controlled" and "completely in control" into two separate scales


"How relaxed or energized do you typically feel in trance?"

Suggestion: Separate relaxed and energized into two different scales
Feedback: Respondent felt mentally energized but physically relaxed, found it difficult to reflect this nuance


Time Passage question (exact wording not provided)

Feedback: What if time passes either slower or faster, depending on the trance, but you don't lose track completely?
Suggestion: Allow for more nuanced responses about time perception


"Do you experience any sensory alterations during trance? (Select all that apply)"

Suggestion: Consider adding options for hypnotic bondage, mind's eye mental imagery, pain/pleasure sensations


"Which of the following suggestions have you experienced in trance? (Select all that apply)"

Suggestion: Add "feeling of being bound (hypnotic bondage)" as an option
Clarify "body part too rigid to move" with "(paralysis)" next to it


"How easy is it to talk or otherwise communicate when you are in trance compared to your normal waking state?"

Suggestion: Separate "talk" and "otherwise communicate" into two questions


"How much more suggestible do you think you are in trance compared to your normal waking state?"

No specific feedback, but consider allowing for variability in experiences


"How aware are you that you're in a trance while you're experiencing it?"

No specific feedback, but ensure clarity on whether this refers to a typical experience or can vary


"How hard is it to get out of trance for you?"

Suggestion: Add words like "usually" to acknowledge that sometimes it's easy and sometimes it's hard


"What aftereffects do you typically experience following a trance session? (Select all that apply)"

No specific feedback, but ensure comprehensive options


"Would you like to describe another trance experience?"

Feedback: Purpose of this question was unclear
Suggestion: Go straight into this part of the survey but mark it as optional



General feedback:

Add a "Back" button to allow revising previous answers
Include a progress indicator or chapter selection
Consider using discrete categories with words instead of sliding scales
Ensure questions are clear about whether they refer to a single trance experience or general experiences
Use a softer background color to reduce eye strain
Ensure unique usernames for respondents
Consider the level of precision needed in responses (e.g., 5.44 vs 5.55 on a scale)
